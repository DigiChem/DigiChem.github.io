<h2>Biography</h2>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigiChem/digichem.github.io/master/_images/TOC_CRPS_2021.png" width="100" height="140">
  Tiago grew up in Setúbal, Portugal and graduated in <b>pharmaceutical sciences (PharmD) from the University of Lisbon</b> in 2006. He then completed his <b>PhD in medicinal chemistry</b> (2010) under the supervision of Dr Francisca Lopes, where he worked on the computational design, synthesis and profiling of potential anti-plasmodial small molecules acting through cytochrome bc1. Next, he moved to the <b>computer-assisted drug design group led by Prof Gisbert Schneider at the ETH Zürich</b> where he worked as a postdoctoral researcher on a range of collaborative projects – spanning from de novo design and microfluidic assisted syntheses to machine learning for deorphanization of natural products – with both academia and industry. In late 2015 he returned to Portugal to work as Marie Curie Fellow and senior researcher in the group of <b>Prof Gonçalo Bernardes at the Instituto de Medicina Molecular</b>, where he co-developed small molecule–ligand conjugates and built machine learning workflows to unveil de modes of action of several high value natural products with anticancer activity. His research resulted in the VC-funded, biotech company <b>TargTex S.A</b>. where he acts as co-founder. 
<br />
<br /> 
He started his independent career in 2018 and moved in 2019 to the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon as a Group Leader. Since 2022 he is an <b>Assistant Professor at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences</b>. He works on the digitalization of chemical sciences, with special focus on merging computation with experimental chemical biology, organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, nanotechnology. His ultimate goal is translating science from bench to clinic to improve healthcare.
<br />
<br />
He has published >60 papers with >15 as senior or co-senior author (h-index 26), delivered >70 presentations at national and international meetings and is inventor in 4 patents.
<br />
<br />
